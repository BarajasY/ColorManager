# ColorManager
Full Stack SpringBoot-React personal project with the mission of letting users find and share some color palettes.

# Stack
This site is a full-stack application, so it uses the next stack:

## `React` `Java` `SpringBoot` `TypeScript` `PostgreSQL` `HTML5` `CSS3`

# Notable Aspects
Since this project requires the need of 2 programming languages, which are no where close to each other (TypeScript && Java), coding this was absolutely a challenge. A Challenge which i'm more than grateful of taking, since it led to me learning a lot more about backend programming, databases, security, API's and their endpoints...
Additionally, the inclusion of many of React technical aspects, such as useContext hook, make this project really complex.
